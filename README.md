# Auction Web App

This is a task thats been given by Scopic. This is a guide how to set it up to work.

# Database

In this app I use PostgreSQL. And when pgAdmin starts to run it asks for a password. I have set it up to be: moviestar123 so that the app can run. To import it in PostgreSQL create a database and click with the left click on it and then choose restore. A menu will open in which you need to add the file scopic-db on it. The database is set to work on localhost:5432.

# Backend

The Backend is developed in Spring. When opening scopic-be with an IDE of your choice run the backend app. The Backend works on localhost:8080

# Frontend

The Frontend is developed in Angular. When running you will be redirected to a login screen in which you need to write admin/admin or user/user to see the behaviour of the app.
The Frontend works on localhost:4200
